# CARBON3D
"In this project, I have employed fundamental HTML and CSS techniques, coupled with guidance from educational resources like YouTube, to craft a captivating 3D model representing a carbon atom suspended in space. This endeavor showcases a fusion of creative design and informative content.

The centerpiece of the project is the intricately designed carbon atom, meticulously crafted to bring out its atomic structure in a visually appealing manner. This 3D representation serves as a captivating visual demonstration of the atomic world, enhancing our understanding of the building blocks of matter.

To augment the educational aspect of the project, I've incorporated an 'information' button, denoted by the letter 'i'. When clicked, this button reveals a wealth of knowledge about the inner workings of carbon atoms. It delves into the fascinating details of neutrons, protons, and electrons that constitute the carbon atom. This feature not only adds depth to the project but also makes it an informative resource for those curious about the atomic realm.

Overall, this project is a testament to the power of HTML and CSS as tools for creative expression and education. It demonstrates a keen eye for design and a commitment to expanding our understanding of the natural world through interactive web development."
